# SMA DNA methylation
This repository contains R scripts for analysing ONT methylation data and bisulfite data.
- Download whole repository to be sure to run all scripts smoothly. Make sure to make directories: "figures" and "results_tables" in the working directory.
- Analysis pipeline was performed with R4.4.0 in RStudio, required libraries are included in the scripts
- Complete dataset is not available due to privacy restrictions. A test dataset is provided in the data directory per analysis to ensure compatibility with the R scripts. This test dataset will not provide sensible results.
